# Kerbal Eggineer Redux

#### This is a joke mod, don't take this seriously ;)

KER is a mod for Kerbal Space Program with tools for viewing important statistics about your ship and it's orbit during both flight, building and in the tracking station.

We, the furries, have invaded Kerbin and has taken over their International Organization for Standardization! 
  
Our local astronaut, [Hiyu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPjn46_5GEae2BAuMh6nAQ) the Pine Marten, inspired the new International Furganization for Furrylization to create a new measurement... or rather, **measuregg** system.

Introducing, the Scarf Measuregg System. The entire system is based on eggs. Because eggs are the best, no argument required.

This is a fork of KER which modifies the units of measurement from the Metric System to the Scarf Measuregg System. It is a joke measurement system that my friends and I made. The specifications are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13BTqFjmOqqpowEPLutmaMUaiM1yZx6HKqyBZ9Il29Xw/edit?usp=sharing).
